1. I guess that the bash script would return 666.  After running the program, it turns out that I was correct.  When trying to replicate the program in Java, I got the result 42 instead.  This is because bash uses dynamic scoping while Java uses lexical scoping.

2. The getters and setters are definitely repetitive.  There is a setter and getter for every variable, resulting in a large chunk of the code becoming very similar.
